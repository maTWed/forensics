**Wrote these for work due to the amount of browsing history requests and decided to share**

*get_browsing_history.sh* - Used to get Firefox & Chrome browsing databases using SMB
*browsing_history_to_csv.py* - Parses the DBs and sorts them into a csv file by time.

Feel free to make them better. They are functional but rough
